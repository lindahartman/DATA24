        "Welcome to the lesson on data visualization!\n",
        "\n",
        "Data visualization is one of the most important skills in data analysis. Why? Because a well-made chart can reveal patterns, trends, and insights that might otherwise stay hidden in a spreadsheet. It’s like turning a jumble of numbers into a picture that tells a story.\n",
        "\n",
        "But let’s be honest—visualizing data can sometimes feel overwhelming. There are so many types of charts to choose from and endless options for customizing them. Scatter plots, bar graphs, heatmaps—what should you use? And even after you pick a plot, there are all these parameters: axis, labels, color scales, gridlines… It’s easy to feel like you’re drowning in options!\n",
        "\n",
        "Point-and-click tools for visualization, like those built into some software, can be helpful, but they come with their own challenges. They often overwhelm you with choices, and worse, they don’t always give you an easy way to reproduce or share your work.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you create visualizations using a script instead of a mouse, you unlock an entirely new level of power. Scripting your plots means they’re reproducible. You can tweak them, reuse them, and share the code with others. It’s like building a recipe that others can follow, modify, or inspect to understand exactly how the visualization was made.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let’s take a step back into history for a moment. In 1999, a statistician named Leland Wilkinson published a groundbreaking book called The Grammar of Graphics. Think of it like this: Just as grammar gives structure to language, Wilkinson’s framework gave structure to statistical graphics. He introduced a way to think about and construct plots systematically, rather than relying on intuition or tradition alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "His ideas were revolutionary and influenced countless tools for making visualizations. One of the most famous examples is the R package `ggplot2`, created by Hadley Wickham. Wickham built on Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics and created what is now considered one of the most powerful and popular visualization tools in the world of data science.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2017 a passionate Python developer from Uganda by the name Hassan Kibridge ported `ggplot2` into Python. His project became known as `plotnine` and it soon became a universal success. Here's the story of `plotnine` in his own words:\n",

        "> I discovered this \"Grammar of Graphics\" thing and found it elegant and powerful. So, I wanted to be able to use it in Python, my preferred programming language for data analysis. I read the key text on the subject by Leland Wilkinson and while I had a good grasp of it, translating it into a usable system would have been a huge undertaking. Hadley Wickham had done so for his doctorate and came up with ggplot2. While I was not confident enough to take this on, I felt that it was quite revolutionary and someone was going to implement it for Python.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> And it happened — a project came up that allowed people to seemingly make plots in Python using a grammar just like ggplot2. I started using it but soon discovered that it did not implement a grammar, it just faked one, and it broke down when you tried to make more complicated plots. Since this project was open source, I contributed to improving it. Yet to fix what was lacking grew into a complete overhaul, and this endeavor is what became Plotnine. The first release of which came out in July 2017 after about 3 years of on-and-off development.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> To my surprise, Plotnine has been more successful than I imagined. For it, I have twice received the Google Open Source Peer Bonus Award—a recognition from Google employees towards open source software that is essential to their work. I have helped someone who was working on a COVID-19 vaccine trial solve a small problem they had run into with Plotnine. And, there is a book or two about it.  \n",

If you’re familiar with Python, you know it’s common practice to use shorthand or aliases when importing libraries. For polars, the standard alias is pl, so that’s what we’ll use here. Anytime we call a function from polars, it will be prefixed with `pl.` — simple and consistent.\n",

        "Now, when it comes to our visualization library, plotnine, we’ll take a slightly different approach. Instead of using a prefix, we’ll import all its functions directly into our workspace.

Because it makes our plotting code cleaner, easier to read, and more expressive.\n",

        "Finally, let’s talk about the dataset we’ll be exploring today. It comes from the gapminder package.

To promote a better understanding of global development through data—focusing on health, economics, and the environment.\n",

        "- **year**: This column tells us the year of the observation. You’ll notice that each country has multiple rows because data was collected at different times. The dataset starts in 1952 and progresses in 5-year increments, which gives us a nice snapshot of changes over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **lifeExp**: This column stands for life expectancy at birth. If we look at Afghanistan in 1952, for example, the life expectancy was just 28.8 years. Let that sink in for a moment — only 28 years! It’s a sobering reminder of the challenges some nations faced in the mid-20th century.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **pop**: This column shows the population of each country. Again, looking at Afghanistan in 1952, the population was just under 8.5 million people.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **gdpPercap**: Finally, this column contains the GDP per capita, expressed in US dollars. From what I understand, these figures have been adjusted for inflation, so they should be comparable across countries and over time.\n",

        "When your graph starts to feel a bit too crowded—perhaps with too many layers or overlapping aesthetics—there’s a simple solution: faceting. Faceting allows you to split your data into separate panels, creating multiple similar graphs for subsets of your data. This can make complex trends easier to spot and comparisons much clearer.\n",
